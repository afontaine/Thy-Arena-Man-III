#THY ARENA MAN III

	A glorious combat arena game designed to prove who is mightiest.

##TODO - In no particular order
- Implement running of the game
- ~~Finish character creation, specifically `Player::Randomize()` and `Player::RandomItems()`~~
- Implement AI
- Implement Network-based mulitplayer with an as-of-yet undecided library
- Create GitHub Pages for project

... and that's all I can think of for now.

##To Compile
###LINUX:
1. Clone
2. make (using GNUmake, if anyone else wants to try a different make, let me know the results!)

###WINDOWS:
1. Clone
2. make (GNUmake port, untested), or put in VC++/Code::Blocks/eclipse/what-have-you and build it that way

NOTE: For Windows, you need [PDCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/) in your library path and the .dll file in the appropriate place as well.

##AS OF NOW
Development is moving to GitHub as the main spot. If you're on Bitbucket, I can't guarantee it's up to date.
